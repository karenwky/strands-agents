      "### Key Features of Strands' AI Tools (Agents):\n",
      "1. **Content Generation**:\n",
      "   - **Copywriting Agents**: Tools for creating marketing copy, product descriptions, email campaigns, and other text-based content.\n",
      "   - **Social Media Agents**: AI-powered platforms for generating engaging posts, captions, and hashtags tailored to platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Customization & Personalization**:\n",
      "   - Agents may allow users to adjust tone (formal, casual, humorous), audience demographics, and brand voice to align with specific marketing goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **SEO Optimization**:\n",
      "   - Some tools might integrate SEO features to suggest keywords, optimize meta tags, or enhance content for search engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Multilingual Support**:\n",
      "   - Agents could support multiple languages, enabling global content creation for international audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration with Platforms**:\n",
      "   - Tools might connect with popular marketing platforms, CRM systems, or content management systems (CMS) for streamlined workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Analytics & Insights**:\n",
      "   - Advanced agents might provide data on content performance, audience engagement, or audience preferences to refine future outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How They Work:\n",
      "Strands' agents likely use **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning (ML)** to analyze user input (e.g., brand guidelines, target audience data) and generate relevant content. Users can input prompts, specify requirements, and refine outputs iteratively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use Cases:\n",
      "- **Businesses**: Automate content creation for blogs, ads, and campaigns.\n",
      "- **Marketers**: Save time on repetitive tasks like email drafting or social media posting.\n",
      "- **Freelancers**: Enhance productivity by leveraging AI for brainstorming or refining ideas.\n",

      "### Note:\n",
      "If \"Strands agents\" refers to a specific product or feature not widely documented, more context would help. However, based on the company's focus on AI-driven content tools, the agents are likely specialized AI models or functions designed to streamline and enhance content creation processes. For precise details, checking Strands' official documentation or contacting their support team would be recommended."

For example, was there a time when another city was the capital? I don\\'t think so. Paris has been the capital since the 13th century, I believe. So no need to mention that unless the user asks for historical details. \\n\\nIn summary, the answer is Paris, and I should present it clearly. Let me check again to ensure accuracy. Yes, Paris is the capital of France. That\\'s the correct answer.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. It is the largest city in France and serves as the country\\'s political, cultural, and economic center. Paris is renowned for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral, as well as its historic significance in art, fashion, and literature.'}]},\n",

Maybe the cat is a cosmic entity or a guardian of the universe. \n",

Here, she curled into a ball, her fur shimmering with the colors of a thousand supernovas. Her breaths were soft, a melody that wove the fabric of the universe together.  \n",

      "First, I need to determine the current time. The previous tool call gave the current time as 2025-05-17T17:12:53 UTC. So today is May 17, 2025, and the time is 5:12 PM UTC. \n",

      "Now, calculate the time difference between now (17:12) and 6:00 AM next day. From 17:12 to midnight is 4 hours and 48 minutes. Then from midnight to 6 AM is 6 hours. Total is 4h48m + 6h = 10 hours and 48 minutes. \n",

      "But I should check if the current time is in the same timezone as the user's wake-up time. The current time was in UTC, but the user's location isn't specified. However, since the user mentioned \"tomorrow morning,\" it's likely they're referring to their local time. But without knowing the timezone, I have to assume UTC for the calculation. \n",

Wait, no. Wait, from 5:12 PM to midnight is 6 hours and 48 minutes. Then from midnight to 6 AM is 6 hours. Total is 6h48m +6h = 12h48m? Wait, no. Wait, 5:12 PM to midnight is 6 hours and 48 minutes (since 5:12 PM + 6h is 11:12 PM, then + 48 minutes is midnight). Then midnight to 6 AM is 6 hours. So total is 6h48m +6h = 12h48m?

      "Wait, but maybe the user is in a timezone where the current time is different. For example, if the user is in a timezone that's UTC+X, then the calculation would change. But since the current time was provided in UTC, and the user hasn't specified their timezone, I'll assume UTC. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the final answer is 12.8 hours. But the user might need the answer in hours and minutes, but the question says \"how many hours,\" so decimal is okay.

The user says \"how many hours can I sleep if I sleep now?\" So they might want the answer in hours, possibly with decimals. \n",
